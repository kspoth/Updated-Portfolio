# Updated-Portfolio

## Project Description

Using a combination of VS Code, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery I developed an application that will allow a user to input their daily tasks into a time slot of their choice. The work day scheduler saves the user inputs to local storage in order for the user to leave the application and come back to it later with the tasks still in the appropriate spot.. This site and application utilizies Javascript and Jquery functions to create and allow this application to run effectively.
