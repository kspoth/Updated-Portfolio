                My name is Kevin Spoth, I graduated Shenandoah University with a Bachelor's in Science in 2012. I have spent most of my professional career as an insurance agent for Ecosystems Insurance Associates, LLC. I have enjoyed my career in this field and the company but I have found a new passion with software development. I have a constant desire to learn
                technologies and expand my knowledge. In the beginning, I was unsure of how to pursue my new passion. I enrolled at J Sargeant Reynolds Community College and enrolled in computer science as well as mathematic courses. I was learning Discrete Mathematics, Calculus, and Object Oriented Programming languages.
                This sparkled my interest further in the technology field specifically coding.
                I then found another opportunity being accepted into the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp. I am familiarizing myself with programming technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git and Github
                through working on projects and exercises daily. I am certain that my passion and interest in technology and business background will benefit your company. My determination and desire to achieve will benefit your team and company.
                I look forward to my future as a Software Developer and would certainly like the
                chance to discuss how my qualifications meet your company’s needs.
