                I graduated Shenandoah University with a Bachelor's of Science in 2012. I have spent most of my professional career as a property and casualty insurance agent for Ecosystems Insurance Associates, LLC. I have enjoyed my career in this field and the company but I have found a new passion with software development. I have a constant desire to learn
                technologies and expand my knowledge. In the beginning, I was unsure of how to pursue my new passion. I enrolled at J Sargeant Reynolds Community College and enrolled in computer science as well as mathematic courses. I was learning Discrete Mathematics, Calculus, and Object Oriented Programming languages.
                This sparkled my interest further in the technology field specifically coding. <br> </br>
                I then found another opportunity being accepted into the University of Richmond's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I am familiarizing myself with programming technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Web API's, NodeJS, JQuery, MySQL, MongoDB, DOM Manipulation, ReactJS, Git and Github
                through working on projects and daily programming excercises. I am certain that my passion and interest in technology and business background will benefit your company. My determination and desire to achieve will benefit your team and company.
                I look forward to my future as a software developer and would certainly like the
                chance to discuss how my qualifications meet your companyâ€™s needs.
